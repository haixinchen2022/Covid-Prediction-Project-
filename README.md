In this project, we built and trained a convolutional neural network in Keras with TensorFlow as a backend from scratch to predict whether patients if were infected with COVID-19 or not using their chest X-ray images. Matplotlib was used for data visualization. Data preprocessing and data augmentation were carried out using TensorFlow 2.0 The model used was sequential with a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, dense layers with reluactivation, and output layer with sigmoid activation. The dataset contained the lungs X-ray images of both groups i.e. non-covid and covid infected patients. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. The metrics chosen for model evaluation were Training set, test set and validation set accuracy. Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 was chosen for gradient descent The entire project was carried out on the Google Colab environment Results of the model were the following
